# PropPiston-NoiseAnalysis
Noise signature analysis of propeller-piston engine powerplants using empirical models and spectral analysis in matlab

This project develops a MATLAB simulation to analyze the noise signature of propeller-driven piston engines, integrating empirical models and spectral analysis. It predicts tonal, broadband, and directional noise characteristics under varying engine speeds and flight conditions.
